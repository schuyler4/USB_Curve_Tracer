The curve tracer is tested by sweeping a number of different resistor values.
Once all this data is collected, a best fit line for each tested resistor value
is found. The percent error between the theoretical resistor IV curve, and the measured
resistor value IV curve is found.



(remember, the curve tracer is only to get a rough idea of the device curve)

The following resistor values are tested: 470, 330, 220
