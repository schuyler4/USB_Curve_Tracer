The curve tracer is tested by sweeping a number of different resistor values.
Once all this data is collected, each data point for each resistor is compared to
the theoretical data point. The theoretical data point is computed at the given 
voltage of the measured data point. If the data for an entire resistor value
stays under 20% error then it means the curve tracer can measure that resistor value 
(remember, the curve tracer is only to get a rough idea of the device curve).

The following resistor values are tested: 470, 330, 220
