<h2> USB Curve Tracer Test Method </h2>
The curve tracer is tested by sweeping a number of different resistor values.
Once all this data is collected, a best fit line for each tested resistor value
is found. The percent error between the theoretical resistor IV curve, and the measured
resistor value IV curve is found.

(remember, the curve tracer is only to get a rough idea of the device curve)

This method verifies the curve tracers correct operation at all the test resistances.
Even if the resistance happens to be the static resistance when sweeping a semiconductor
device. 

The following resistor values are tested: 470, 330, 220
